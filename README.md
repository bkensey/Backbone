Backbone File Manager
=====================

Backbone is a brand new file manager for Android 4.0 and up.  We wrote Backbone to strike a balance between intuitive use and powerful functionality so that you'd be covered whether you're to modifying system file permissions or just organizing downloads. 

Android has matured - isn't it time your file manager did the same?

Backbone is based on on the amazing [CMFileManager](https://github.com/CyanogenMod/android_packages_apps_CMFileManager) by Jorge Ruesga
